For under $150, you can get dual-band ADS-B In traffic and weather with WAAS position data. It's fantastic.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<h2>In use</h2>\n<p>The one thing you might want to add is suction cups or velcro tape to position the unit. I fly a Grumman AA-1A, which (like the AA-5 Traveler/Cheetah and AG-5B Tiger) has an aluminum honeycomb fuselage structure. My best reception involved positioning the  with the antennas in a vertical orientation. This would not be as necessary in something like a Piper or Cessna.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1000px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/638e4b7049e1b2ccb651d1abed799269/5c15c/stratux_2.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 88.5486018641811%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Current setup\"\n        title=\"Current setup\"\n        src=\"/static/638e4b7049e1b2ccb651d1abed799269/971c4/stratux_2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/638e4b7049e1b2ccb651d1abed799269/9fb78/stratux_2.jpg 250w,\n/static/638e4b7049e1b2ccb651d1abed799269/48a11/stratux_2.jpg 500w,\n/static/638e4b7049e1b2ccb651d1abed799269/971c4/stratux_2.jpg 1000w,\n/static/638e4b7049e1b2ccb651d1abed799269/45751/stratux_2.jpg 1500w,\n/static/638e4b7049e1b2ccb651d1abed799269/5c15c/stratux_2.jpg 1502w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>As far as the reception performance goes, it ranges from 'decent' to 'great', depending on the situation. I found that signal strength for traffic is often far better than that for weather. Still, in the Seattle area, I frequently see 4 or more ground stations in ForeFlight, which keeps weather up to date satisfactorily. South of Portland, reception can drop to a single tower. I haven't compared this to a Stratus 2S unit, but minimal ground stations exist out there in the first place.</p>\n<p>GPS reception isn't perfect - it's not an external antenna, so accuracy is typically good at best - but it's totally functional. I use ForeFlight track recordings to debrief instrument training and currency flights, and it works great.</p>\n<h2>Compared to OEM equipment</h2>\n<p>I've flown with pilots who have Stratus 2S units, and they seem pretty comparable. ForeFlight AHRS fed by a Stratus 2S is glitchy but usable; new Stratux builds support AHRS with the right hardware, but I haven't been able to compare.</p>\n<p>Two months ago, we installed the Stratus ESGi transponder in our Grumman. The ESG is an ADS-B Out transponder, with a hard connection to a battery-less \"Stratus 2i\". Because it's receiving 978 and 1090 signals via the belly-mounted transponder antenna, the signal strength is exceptional and outperforms the Stratux... but installed cost was around $4,000. Getting similar performance for $150 is a steal.</p>\n<p>Some in the community use a splitter to connect a DME belly antenna to their dual-band Stratux, and they report similar impressive results. If you've got the old hardware still dragging along, getting an A&#x26;P to rig up a BNC to SMA adapter can be a powerful option.</p>\n<p>No matter what you build, check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/cyoung/stratux\">community on GitHub</a> and consider contributing! There's a fair number of contributors on the <a href=\"http://slack.stratux.me/\">Slack chat</a> as well.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Building and Flying with Stratux ADS-B In, part 2","date":"2017-07-17 18:00"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"flying/open-source/building-and-flying-with-stratux-ads-b-in-part-2"}}}
