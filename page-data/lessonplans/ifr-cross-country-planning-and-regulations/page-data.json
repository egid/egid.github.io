Since clouds are a form of visible moisture, flying through clouds at an altitude that is near or below freezing would constitute flight into known icing conditions.\"</li>\n<li>\"Flight into known icing conditions when the airplane flight manual or pilot operating handbook prohibits such flight would constitute a violation whether the aircraft accretes ice or not.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Airframe temperature may be below freezing when OAT is not, causing water droplets to accumulate as rime ice in temperatures above freezing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>§91.121 -- Altimeter settings</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Altimeter must be set to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reported altimeter setting from a station within 100 nm along the route <em>when below 18,000 ft MSL</em></li>\n<li>29.92\" Hg <em>when at or above 18,000 ft MSL</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>§91.167 -- Fuel requirements for flight in IFR conditions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>45 minute fuel reserve should be carried</li>\n<li>enough fuel to fly to the destination, shoot the approach, and divert to the alternate <em>without dipping into the reserve</em></li>\n<li>\n<p>1-2-3 rule allows us to eliminate the alternate fuel requirement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For at least 1 hour before, and for 1 hour after the estimated time of arrival, the ceiling will be at least 2,000 feet above the airport elevation and the visibility will be at least 3 statute miles.</li>\n<li>Required alternates must have approaches <em>other than GPS</em> available at the ETA.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>§91.177 -- Minimum altitudes for IFR operations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an aircraft under IFR below minimum altitudes prescribed in §95 and §97 <em>or</em>, if no minimum altitude designated,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>over mountainous areas an altitude of 2,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal distance of 4 nautical miles from the course to be flown</li>\n<li>an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal distance of 4 nautical miles from the course to be flown</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If an MEA and MOCA are established, operations are permitted below the MEA but not below the MOCA when within 22 nm of the station</li>\n<li>\n<p>Climb to a higher minimum altitude should begin immediately after passing the point beyond which that minimum altitude applies</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when ground obstructions are present, the point should be crossed at or above the applicable MCA</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>§91.179 -- IFR cruising altitude or flight level</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When in controlled airspace, fly ATC assigned headings and altitudes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if VFR on top, fly VFR cruising altitudes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When in uncontrolled airspace, below 18,000 ft MSL, and on a course between:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0-179°, fly odd thousands</li>\n<li>180-359°, fly even thousands</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>§91.181 -- Course to be flown</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fly the centerline of an airway, or on a direct course between navaids</li>\n<li>Maneuvering to avoid aircraft or to clear the flight path in VFR is permitted</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&#x26;sid=da2485cc5f823c50f004c6b5e8bebd85&#x26;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title14/14cfr95_main_02.tpl\">§95.x -- IFR Altitudes</a></h4>\n<p>As defined in §95.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MAA(maximum authorized altitude) defines the upper limit of an airway</li>\n<li>MCA(minimum crossing altitude) determines the lowest permitted altitude when <em>crossing the waypoint or fix</em> to a higher altitude segment</li>\n<li>MEA(minimum enroute altitude) is the lowest altitude permitted on the <em>entire</em> route, airway, or segment</li>\n<li>MOCA(minimum obstruction clearance altitude) provides safe obstacle clearance along the route or airway, but reception is only guaranteed within 25 nm of the station</li>\n<li>MRA(minimum reception altitude) is the lowest altitude at which an intersection can be determined using ground stations</li>\n<li>COP(change-over point) suggests the best point to switch to the next station along an airway, guaranteeing continuous reception between facilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mountainous areas are defined by latitude and longitude.</p>\n<h3>IFR cross-country planning</h3>\n<p>Materials should include: A/FD, enroute and area charts, departure procedures, STARs, and approach plates for the intended route of flight.</p>\n<h4>Weather</h4>\n<p>Get an IFR briefing from FSS or a DUAT provider, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>current and forecast conditions for departure, enroute, arrival, and alternate</li>\n<li>winds aloft</li>\n<li>ATC flow control</li>\n<li>NOTAMs</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Enroute charts</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Use FliteStar to show Jeppesen format</li>\n<li>Compare to approach plates</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Nav log preparation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Take advantage of the FAA's existing routes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>start with a departure procedure</li>\n<li>find STARs, if available, or the best approach's IAF</li>\n<li>connect the dots using airways</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>ATC may assign a different route, if traffic is high</li>\n<li>\n<p>Factor in any performance considerations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>climb rates</li>\n<li>winds aloft</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Determine cruising altitude using magnetic course and MEA</li>\n<li>Consider alternates enroute as well as at destination</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Lost communications</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Route
