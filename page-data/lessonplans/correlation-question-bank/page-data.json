Why?</li>\n<li>Re: an XC between KPAE and KSHN: obstruction near KPWT. How does it impact the flight based on weather? How about if the altimeter setting is not reset?</li>\n<li>Describe an aircraft in a slip or skid. Which wing will stall (or drop) first?</li>\n<li>Pose medical emergencies while on a cross-country near airspace.</li>\n<li>How high can an aircraft go between two points? Consider service ceiling, weather, aeromedical factors, airspace, etc.</li>\n<li>Premium is cheaper than avgas, so can we put it in our airplane? Why or why not?</li>\n<li>What role do ailerons have in a spin in a Piper Cub? How about a Cirrus?</li>\n<li>Crossing KOLM, do we need to talk? (What altitude? Is the tower open?)</li>\n<li>We lose comms outside of KOLMâ€™s airspace. Can we enter their airspace and land?</li>\n<li>How does published service ceiling relate to V<sub>X</sub> and V<sub>Y</sub>?</li>\n<li>What is absolute ceiling?</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Private Pilot question bank","date":"2008-12-22 22:26","camera":null,"description":null},"fields":{"slug":"lessonplans/correlation-question-bank/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"lessonplans/correlation-question-bank/"}}}
