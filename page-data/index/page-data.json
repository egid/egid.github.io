It uses software-defined radios to pick up ADS-B data, then processes it using <a href=\"http://github.com/cyoung/stratux\">open-source software</a>. As a pilot who's dabbled with the idea of plunking down around $1000 on the Stratus 2S, this was a pretty attractive idea: less than $200 for traffic and weather on my iPad? Heck, I could build a receiver and order a new iPad for less than the list price of the Stratus.</p>\n<p>I took the plunge, ordered the parts, and tried it out.</p>\n<p>The verdict? It works brilliantly.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"id":"0619faf1-8ab7-51fa-833c-e938854f9bef","frontmatter":{"title":"Plan of Action: Flight Review","date":"2013-04-20 20:12","category":"lessonplans","description":"A basic outline for a complete Flight Review in the United States."},"fields":{"slug":"lessonplans/flight-review"},"excerpt":"<p>This is a basic outline for a complete Flight Review.
