<p>If you&rsquo;re a pilot without existing access to ADS-B In weather and traffic, build this list. The same results <a href="http://ericgideon.com/flying/open-source/building-and-flying-with-stratux-homebuilt-ads-b-in/">cost $233 a year ago</a>, and the software has matured while the hardware has improved. For under $150, you can get dual-band ADS-B In traffic and weather with WAAS position data. It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>In use</h2>

<p>The one thing you might want to add is suction cups or velcro tape to position the unit. I fly a Grumman AA-1A, which (like the AA-5 Traveler/Cheetah and AG-5B Tiger) has an aluminum honeycomb fuselage structure. My best reception involved positioning the  with the antennas in a vertical orientation. This would not be as necessary in something like a Piper or Cessna.</p>

<p><img src="/images/stratux_2.jpg" alt="Current setup" /></p>

<p>As far as the reception performance goes, it ranges from &lsquo;decent&rsquo; to &lsquo;great&rsquo;, depending on the situation. I found that signal strength for traffic is often far better than that for weather. Still, in the Seattle area, I frequently see 4 or more ground stations in ForeFlight, which keeps weather up to date satisfactorily. South of Portland, reception can drop to a single tower. I haven&rsquo;t compared this to a Stratus 2S unit, but minimal ground stations exist out there in the first place.</p>

<p>GPS reception isn&rsquo;t perfect &ndash; it&rsquo;s not an external antenna, so accuracy is typically good at best &ndash; but it&rsquo;s totally functional. I use ForeFlight track recordings to debrief instrument training and currency flights, and it works great.</p>

<h2>Compared to OEM equipment</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve flown with pilots who have Stratus 2S units, and they seem pretty comparable. ForeFlight AHRS fed by a Stratus 2S is glitchy but usable; new Stratux builds support AHRS with the right hardware, but I haven&rsquo;t been able to compare.</p>

<p>Two months ago, we installed the Stratus ESGi transponder in our Grumman. The ESG is an ADS-B Out transponder, with a hard connection to a battery-less &ldquo;Stratus 2i&rdquo;. Because it&rsquo;s receiving 978 and 1090 signals via the belly-mounted transponder antenna, the signal strength is exceptional and outperforms the Stratux&hellip; but installed cost was around $4,000. Getting similar performance for $150 is a steal.</p>

<p>Some in the community use a splitter to connect a DME belly antenna to their dual-band Stratux, and they report similar impressive results. If you&rsquo;ve got the old hardware still dragging along, getting an A&amp;P to rig up a BNC to SMA adapter can be a powerful option.</p>

<p>No matter what you build, check out the <a href="https://github.com/cyoung/stratux">community on GitHub</a> and consider contributing! There&rsquo;s a fair number of contributors on the <a href="http://slack.stratux.me/">Slack chat</a> as well.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3><a href="/flying/open-source/building-and-flying-with-stratux-ads-b-in-part-2/">UPDATE: new writeup 17 July 2017, with a new $140 parts list</a></h3>

<p>I first heard about the <a href="http://stratux.me">Stratux project</a> a few months back, in a <a href="http://reddit.com/r/stratux">subreddit</a> that described how to build your own ADS-B In receiver for under $120. It uses software-defined radios to pick up ADS-B data, then processes it using <a href="http://github.com/cyoung/stratux">open-source software</a>. As a pilot who&rsquo;s dabbled with the idea of plunking down around $1000 on the Stratus 2S, this was a pretty attractive idea: less than $200 for traffic and weather on my iPad? Heck, I could build a receiver and order a new iPad for less than the list price of the Stratus.</p>

<p>I took the plunge, ordered the parts, and tried it out.</p>

<p>The verdict? It works brilliantly.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I started with the suggested parts to build a single-radio device, much like the original Stratus or the new 1S, and spent around $10 more on a slightly better external battery pack. Assembly is simple: plug the radios into the USB ports, and (if you&rsquo;ve got a case) screw the Raspberry Pi down. Here&rsquo;s my original build:</p>

<p><img src="/images/stratux_v1.jpg" alt="Original setup" /></p>

<ul>
<li>$69.99: <a href="http://amzn.to/1pPNaGh">Vilros Raspberry Pi 2 starter kit</a> &ndash; now sold with the Raspberry Pi 3. Comes with a case, SD card, and wall power.</li>
<li>$22.50: <a href="http://amzn.to/1Pxtz20">NooElec NESDR Mini 2</a> &ndash; this is the software-defined radio that receives ADS-B data. <strong>Note</strong>: don&rsquo;t buy this one, get the newer Nano 2.</li>
<li>$36.99: <a href="http://amzn.to/1Pxs18a">Anker Astro E5</a> power bank. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this purely because of how massive it is. Use ship power or a smaller battery.</li>
<li>After tax, this put me at $142.42, not including the blue tape &ndash; still pretty reasonable.</li>
</ul>


<p>This build got me the bare minimum: 978Mhz (UAT) weather, plus traffic if we were near enough to an ADS-B Out equipped aircraft to get the messages meant for them. After reading some more posts that added GPS (and the possibility of AHRS &ndash; basically making it a Stratus 2S), I ordered a Reyax RY835AI for $46.00 via eBay. This GPS isn&rsquo;t recommended anymore, as it&rsquo;s glitchy and require soldering, but it works fine.</p>

<p>That setup &ndash; GPS + 978Mhz &ndash; took us to Reno for the Air Races, and worked flawlessly the whole way. Between Seattle and Sacramento, where we picked up our car, we saw between one and three ADS-B towers the entire trip.</p>

<p><img src="/images/stratux_installed.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After that first trip proved how useful it was, getting us weather and traffic far in advance and with very little workload, I&rsquo;ve gotten more involved in the Stratux community and continued building out my receiver. After a few others had success with using MakeXYZ to 3D-print cases, I ordered one and set it up.</p>

<p>More recently, I picked up two of the newer NooElec Nano2 SDRs to save space, then joined them to share a single antenna. Here&rsquo;s the current parts list:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also got a 10' USB extension cable, and a 2-port, 2.1A car charger that provides power for the Stratux and one iPad or smartphone. This means you can skip the battery pack, or get a much smaller one for backup purposes. The 10' cable allows me to mount it in the back of the baggage compartment, and the 6' SMA cable lets the antenna hang in the center of the cabin where it gets the best reception.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to blow past the original $120 promise, but the value is pretty impossible to beat. Add in the fact that the community is very active on both <a href="http://reddit.com/r/stratux">reddit</a> and <a href="http://github.com/cyoung/stratux">github</a>, and you&rsquo;ve got a pretty much future-proof Stratus replacement.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thatguyeric/8088858114/" title="AlÞing (site of the world's first parliament), Þingvallir, Ísland by thatguyeric, on Flickr"><img class="flex-content" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8183/8088858114_21298589de_b.jpg" width="1024" height="228" alt="AlÞing (site of the world's first parliament), Þingvallir, Ísland"></a></p>

<p>I previously talked about <a href="/flying/travel/flying-in-iceland">figuring out how to use an FAA certificate</a> and other steps towards flight-seeing as a pilot in Iceland. This is a more in-depth review of the planning involved, what I used, and where I went.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Planning</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thatguyeric/8296171156/" title="Flying in Iceland! by thatguyeric, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8500/8296171156_d7945a06ff.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Flying in Iceland!"></a>One of the major difficulties I had in researching my flights was getting charts and information about airspace and facilities around Iceland. I found this out too late to be of use for my trip, but airspace, airways, and other Icelandic chart data are now available online at <a href="http://skyvector.com/?ll=64.13042283188456,-21.94042969313066&amp;chart=301&amp;zoom=9">SkyVector</a>.  Their data compares accurately to the paper chart I borrowed, and can help with figuring out where to go and how to get there.</p>

<p>Airport (aerodrome) information can be found by browsing through the <a href="http://www.caa.is/FlugmalahandbokinAIP/AeronauticalInformationPublication/">Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP)</a>, the functional equivalent to a mashup of regulations similar to our FARs, some IFR enroute charts, and a couple of terminal approach diagrams and airport maps. Take your time and give it a read &mdash; everything is in English, and some parts are also in Icelandic. It isn&rsquo;t as bland as the FAR, so be thorough! Many airports have gravel runways and limited facilities, and you don&rsquo;t want to find out the hard way.</p>

<p>Weather information is available via the <a href="http://en.vedur.is/weather/aviation/">Icelandic Met Office</a>, where you can explore a rather nice selection of aviation weather products. Most of what you&rsquo;re familiar with in the states from the Aviation Weather Center is on hand, though often in a different format. Both of my flights were slightly iffy weather-wise &mdash; the fall &amp; winter leaves Iceland with lots of low scud much of the time, but when it clears, it&rsquo;s gorgeous. Give yourself some options and book a couple backup flights.</p>

<h3>Operational differences</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thatguyeric/8295118463/" title="Flying in Iceland! by thatguyeric, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8362/8295118463_13c692a37c.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Flying in Iceland!"></a>One of the weirdest mental changes I had to make was the flight plan system. Unlike the US, all flights must be on a flight plan &mdash; and (at least when operating at Reykjavik) you file with the control tower of the airport where you are based. Outside of towered airports I think you wind up filing and closing with the enroute ATC.</p>

<p>Also important to reiterate &mdash; most of the airports in Iceland are pretty bare bones even when compared to small fields in the US. Avgas is uncommon, and paved runways are a luxury. The gravel surfaces available are good, but they&rsquo;re still gravel. Don&rsquo;t expect to find a terminal or tiedown facilities everywhere, either.</p>

<h3>Language</h3>

<p>Everybody speaks English. Seriously, every single person I encountered in Iceland spoke incredibly fluent English. Pronouncing the names of places is intimidating, but it seemed like every Icelander had their own pronounciation, so I didn&rsquo;t run into any issues working with air traffic control. And of course, just like flying in the US, you can always just ask questions or state intentions in plain language and get your point across just fine.</p>

<h3>What it costs</h3>

<p>Probably the most important question anybody has about flying, but also probably the one with the most immediately outdated answers. <strong>Long story short &mdash; it costs more than the US, but much less than Europe.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.tskoli.is/flugskoli-islands/english">Flugskóli Íslands</a>, the flight school that I rented from, requires a checkout flight with one of their instructors before allowing you to rent solo. At the time that I was visiting, a Cessna 172S rented for <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=24750&amp;From=ISK&amp;To=USD">24,750 ISK</a> an hour (wet), which converted to around $188, and the instructor rate was <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=5900&amp;From=ISK&amp;To=USD">5,900 ISK</a> an hour, around $45. I flew with Kristófer, and he was professional, friendly, and more than happy to help us improve our trip, from picking a destination for our flight to suggesting restaurants in Reykjavik. The rentals have no minimum, which means you can book a plane for the length of time you think you&rsquo;ll need, and only pay for the block time &mdash; which is minutes elapsed from engine start to shutdown, for those used to Hobbs billing.</p>

<h3>Where to go</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thatguyeric/8088859076/" title="Gulfoss (Golden Falls), Ísland by thatguyeric, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8465/8088859076_36d89c1b3e.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Gulfoss (Golden Falls), Ísland"></a>After talking with our instructor and some of the other staff at Flugskóli Íslands, we settled on Stykkishólmur as our destination. It&rsquo;s a small city in the northwest of Iceland, and about .9 hours flying time away from Reykjavik &mdash; <a href="http://skyvector.com/?ll=64.61587193873675,-22.169311529060174&amp;chart=301&amp;zoom=5&amp;plan=A.BI.BIRK:G.64.1763235316484,-21.865539556414546:G.64.33538793457097,-21.830749517353265:G.64.9261025904075,-22.381896978271467:A.BI.BIST">here&rsquo;s an approximation of the route we flew</a>. We didn&rsquo;t have a ton of time to explore (I strongly recommend booking the airplane for the whole day) but it looked like a neat little fishing town.</p>

<p>Also recommended was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestmannaeyjar">Vestmannaeyjar</a>, an island community off the south coast. If you&rsquo;re less interested in getting out and exploring a destination, you could probably do an aerial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Circle_(Iceland">Golden Circle Tour</a>). You wouldn&rsquo;t get up super close, but you would be able to see Þingvellir, Geysir (the original geyser), and the waterfall Gulfoss. Honestly, though, just getting into the air over Iceland is cool enough. The entire island is gorgeous, rain or shine, and it&rsquo;s an amazing experience. Enjoy, and if you&rsquo;ve got questions feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=egid&amp;original_referer=http://ericgideon.com/flying/travel/flight-seeing-in-iceland/">ask me @egid on twitter</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thatguyeric/8296170396/in/photostream/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8351/8296170396_d4f6f7f4a7.jpg" class="right"></a>Shanna and I recently took a week-long trip to Iceland, where I was lucky enough to get some flying in. When we&rsquo;d  stopped over in Reykjavik for a couple days during a previous trip to Europe, I noticed how many light aircraft were in the air. The landscape is so weird and compelling that getting up in the air became a mandatory part of our return to Iceland.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s not a ton of information about flying in Iceland on an FAA certificate. I found a <a href="http://www.pprune.org/private-flying/116715-flying-iceland.html">2004 thread on the PPRuNe forum</a> that didn&rsquo;t offer much, and <a href="http://www.hang-out.co.uk/index.php/flying/iceland">another article</a> that had some useful info on where to fly, but prices &amp; recommendations from 1998. Eventually, I just scraped around the <a href="http://caa.is/english">English-language version of the ICAA website</a> (the Icelandic Civil Aviation Authority) and emailed them directly, asking what I needed to do to fly there. <!-- more --> I got a response within 24 hours:</p>

<blockquote><p>Foreign visitors in Iceland can use their valid and current ICAO pilot licence for three months for private VFR flights in Icelandic airspace in aeroplanes registered in Iceland. So as long you as licence is current and valid and you have sufficient privileges to fly the aeroplane in question. You can fly private VFR for three months in Icelandic airspace without having to validate your licence.</p></blockquote>

<p>Great news &ndash; no need for lengthy and costly process of validation. At this point, things got simpler, as the only task left was finding a place to rent an aircraft.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thatguyeric/8295117743/in/photostream"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8498/8295117743_549235b296.jpg" class="right"></a>I contacted <a href="http://www.tskoli.is/flugskoli-islands/english">Flugskóli Íslands</a> and <a href="http://www.icelandairclub.com">Iceland Airclub</a> to check prices and restrictions. There are other flight schools and rental FBOs, but the ones I saw didn&rsquo;t offer english websites, or were outside of Reykjavik, which excluded them right off the bat. Flugskóli Íslands has a fairly large fleet of Cessnas (C-152, C-172N, C-172S), allows solo rental with no minimum block time, and requires potential renters do a one-hour checkout with instructor. Iceland Airclub has a few PA-28s, but allows dual flights only – unless you pay dearly to become a member.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t really a difficult decision, once I had the information, and I scheduled a couple of flights with Flugskóli Íslands well in advance. They&rsquo;re the busiest flight school in Iceland, so this might not be a terrible idea. They&rsquo;re friendly and very responsive to emails, so don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact them.</p>

I got married, flew our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thatguyeric/sets/72157621661336277/">newly-restored &amp; upgraded Grumman</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thatguyeric/sets/72157625344903588/">spent three weeks in Europe &amp; Iceland</a>, started looking into Masters programs, stopped instructing full time, and got a Real Job™. Oh, and http://aeronaut.ca now redirects to http://ericgideon.com, so update your shit. It&#8217;s been a fun year, I&#8217;ve enjoyed the changes so far, and I&#8217;m looking forward to what the future holds. The only downside to leaving instruction is that I spend a lot of time wishing I was flying, but &#8211; and this is key &#8211; <em>all of my flying I now enjoy</em>.</p>

The two of us went to the Reno Air Races, then visited Germany &amp; Austria, via Iceland. Flying Icelandair was an interesting look at how small airlines can serve smaller markets with narrow routes and the appropriate aircraft. Not to mention, their <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thatguyeric/5451625367/">branding</a> (and cabin crew) was fantastic.</p>




<p>As far as the future goes, I&#8217;m looking heavily into masters programs in the field of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors">Human Factors</a>, with the goal of taking that degree into the aviation industry. I&#8217;ve spent so much time working with technology &amp; usability, both in aviation and in web design, that I can&#8217;t see any other path but this. If you&#8217;ve got advice or thoughts on human factors &amp; aviation, I would welcome your input!</p>
