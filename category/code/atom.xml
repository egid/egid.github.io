    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s always fascinated me that most pilots first become professionals as flight instructors. Before starting jobs at airlines or charter companies, most pilots' careers begin by teaching brand-new private students the basics of aviation. Not everybody is good, and most don&rsquo;t do it for long even if they are, but it&rsquo;s somehow become The Way It Works in aviation.</p>

<p>I spent three years teaching at multiple levels, and one of the first things I realized is just how damn hard it is to be an educator. I&rsquo;m not comparing the relatively straightforward, one-to-one tutoring that is flight instruction with teaching a classroom full of highschoolers, or anything like that, but it&rsquo;s tough. If you want to know a subject thoroughly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching">teach it</a> &mdash; so, basically the opposite of that bullshit &ldquo;those who can&rsquo;t, teach&rdquo; saying.</p>

<p>The main textbook of a CFI course is the <a href="http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/aviation_instructors_handbook/"><em>Aviation Instructor&rsquo;s Handbook</em></a>, which dives into some of the psychology of learning. One of the core concepts is that students should move from simple to complex &mdash; &ldquo;everything from intricate cognitive processes to simple motor skills depends on what the student already knows and how that knowledge can be applied in the present.&rdquo; It works well, and allows people to pick up big ideas gradually and sanely.</p>

<p>What I find hard to believe, now that I&rsquo;ve moved into a field other than teaching, is how poorly understood some of these concepts seem to be. There are plenty of websites &amp; smartphone apps that offer up incredible complexity, but do little more than fire up an intro tour. These are shockingly useless, <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2011/02/01/unnecessary-explanations">as Khoi Vinh explains so well</a>; most users won&rsquo;t be able to memorize what you&rsquo;re telling them &mdash; and this is an important distinction: you&rsquo;re <em>telling</em>, not <strong>showing</strong>. Luke Wroblewski spoke a bit about this issue in his <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/6051/">talk at An Event Apart</a>, suggesting that instead developers use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_in_Time_Teaching">just-in-time teaching</a> as people interact, like what Facebook does every time they launch a new feature.</p>

<p>The <em>Aviation Instructor&rsquo;s Handbook</em> suggests a similar technique, one that served me well in briefings and on flights: the accurately-but-uninspiringly-named &ldquo;Telling-and-Doing Technique&rdquo;. Unlike traditional lectures, the sequence of teaching &amp; demonstration looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thatguyeric/238642854/" title="DO NOT TOUCH GLASS by thatguyeric, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/93/238642854_edbbebad1c_z.jpg?zz=1" alt="DO NOT TOUCH GLASS"></a></p>

<ol>
<li>Preparation</li>
<li>Instructor tells + instructor does</li>
<li>Student tells + instructor does</li>
<li>Student tells + student does</li>
<li>Student does + instructor evaluates</li>
</ol>


<p>The parallels to interaction work pretty well &mdash; the sequence could probably be adapted to skip the instructor tells &amp; does stage, which would otherwise be a demo, instead moving straight into an interactive, prompted first-run through a series of features. Add in some context- or timing-aware hooks so that your walkthrough can fire a second time, perhaps if somebody seems stuck or inactive.</p>

<p>Barring a better tutorial, just get people using your app. Even better, introduce features in <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1648">small, digestable chunks</a>, so that they can learn as they go. Skip the tutorial and let them learn by doing.</p>
